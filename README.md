Automated Horse Water Heater Control System


### Description:
This project is designed to utilize a Raspberry Pi to host a web-interfaced automatic horse trough water heater control. The individual outlets will be controlled by small home-automation outlets, each interfaced with the R-PI. Temperature control is incorporated and utilized to manage load switching.
